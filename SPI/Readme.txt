I have no familiarity with bare metal coding of communication protocols, hence I attempted this question using arduino libraries only.

Regarding simulation, Wokwi does not support multiple arduinos and TinkerCAD does not support arduino's SPI library. Hence I was not able to simulate this

Code for the Master and Slave is attached
